Track your focus level using EEG data and brainwave analysis
# EEG Focus Tracker ðŸ§ 

This is a fun beginner neuroscience project that uses EEG brainwave data (simulated for now!) to estimate your *focus level* based on alpha and beta waves.

## How It Works
- Simulates EEG readings over time
- Calculates a "focus score" using a simple algorithm
- Plots your brain state in a Jupyter notebook
